## FeLine - A command-line client for AI models.
![banner](static/face.png)

### Introduction
FeLine is a command-line tool that lets you interact with a language model in a powerful way: it allows you to include the output of terminal (Bash) commands directly in your conversations. Imagine getting real-time system information, analyzing data, running scripts, and more — all within a natural conversation.

### Install
###1. Pre-requisites
- Get your API key on the Google Studio platform
[aistudio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

- Install the Python 3 version corresponding to your operative system.
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


###2. Download the project:
```bash
# Using curl
sudo rm -rf /opt/FeLine && \
curl -L -o FeLine.zip https://github.com/vizard418/FeLine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && \
sudo unzip FeLine.zip -d /opt/ && \
sudo mv /opt/FeLine-main /opt/FeLine && \
rm FeLine.zip
```

```powershell
# Powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/vizard418/FeLine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "FeLine.zip"; Expand-Archive -Path "FeLine.zip" -DestinationPath "Feline" -Force; Remove-Item "FeLine.zip"
```

###3. Create a Python virtual environment:
*   Install the `virtualenv` package for Python 3 using pip. If you encounter issues on Linux, you can alternatively try your distribution's package manager.
    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install virtualenv
    cd FeLine
    python3 -m virtualenv .venv
    ```

* Activate enviroment & install dependendences:
    **On Unix-based systems:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate && \
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
    deactivate
    ```

    **On Windows:**
    ```powershell
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    deactivate
    ```

4. Add to PATH.
* On Unix-based systems, add the following lines to your shell configuration file. (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`)
    ```bash
    # FeLine (A command-line AI agent)
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="[YourApiKey]"
    export PATH="$PATH:/opt/FeLine"
    ```
    *   *[Important]* Reload config 
        ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

* On Windows, you need to modify the environment variables to add the project folder path. For example: `C:\Program Files\FeLine`.

## Basic usage:
The most basic FeLine command is to enter interactive chat mode with: `feline -i`
Or you can also view help with the *--help* flag: `feline --help`

## How to use `$` in feline for images and shell commands:
`feline` utilizes the `$` symbol for special instructions within your prompts.  Here's how to use it:

*   **For Image Processing:**  Use `$[path/to/your/image.jpg]` or `$[path/to/your/image.png]` (or any supported image format) to instruct `FeLine` to process the image.  Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file.  For example:
    ```bash
    feline -i
    ███████╗███████╗██╗     ██╗███╗   ██╗███████╗
    ██╔════╝██╔════╝██║     ██║████╗  ██║██╔════╝
    █████╗  █████╗  ██║     ██║██╔██╗ ██║█████╗
    ██╔══╝  ██╔══╝  ██║     ██║██║╚██╗██║██╔══╝
    ██║     ███████╗███████╗██║██║ ╚████║███████╗
    ╚═╝     ╚══════╝╚══════╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚══════╝
    ** Imagination Is The Limit **

    [INFO] Local files... [OK]

    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > Describe this image: $[/home/user/pictures/my_cat.jpg]
    >
    [IMAGE] /home/user/pictures/my_cat.jpg
    ```

*    * **Sinlge-Line Command Prompts**
    * On Unix-based systems (exec `cat` command): `feline "Summarize the key statements from my notes. $(cat notes.md)"`
    * On Windows CMD (exec `type` command): `feline "Summarize the key statements from my notes. $(type notes.md)"`)


*   **For Shell Command Execution:** Use `$()` around your shell command. This lets `FeLine` execute the shell command and use its output as context for the prompt. For example:
    * On Unix-based systems: `feline "Summarize the output of the ls -l $(ls -l)" -i`
    * Windows CMD (`dir` command): `feline "Summarize the output of dir /a $(dir /a)" -i`

    ```markdown
    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > Summarize the output of the ls -l $(ls -l)"
    >
    [SHELL] ls -l

    [FELINE]
    The output shows a detailed listing of the user's home directory contents, including: ...

    ```
    **Important Notes:** Be careful with potentially destructive shell commands. Ensure you trust the prompt and the commands you are executing.

### Run feline. Examples:
*   **Text comprehension:** (`feline -i`)
    ```markdown
    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > How does AI work
    >

    [FELINE]
    AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a vast and complex field, but at its core, it's about building computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence...
    ---
    ```

*   **Complex tasks:** (`feline --model gemini-flash -i` or `feline --model gemini-pro -i`)
    ```markdown
    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > Explains the relationship between climate change and human migration, highlighting both direct and indirect causes, and offers concrete examples from vulnerable regions.

    ## Climate Change and Human Migration: A Complex Relationship
    Climate change is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of human migration, influencing both the frequency and scale of population movements globally. This relationship is multifaceted, involving direct impacts of climate-related hazards and indirect consequences that exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and trigger displacement...

    ```

*   **Image recognition:** (`feline -i` or `feline --model {model_keyword} -i`)
    ```markdown
    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > How many animals do you see in the image? $[/home/user/Downloads/animals.jpg]
    >
    [IMAGE] /home/user/Downloads/animals.jpg

    [FELINE]
    I can see 8 animals in the image:
    *   Giraffe
    *   Lion
    *   Zebra
    *   Ostrich
    *   Elephant
    *   Tiger
    *   Rhinoceros
    ---
    ```

*   **Extra utils:** Can run shell commands: (`feline -i` or `feline --model {model_keyword} -i` or `feline "Translate me into Klingon $(man chmod)"`)
    ```markdown
    [USER] **Press Return 2 times to exit**
    > Translate me into Klingon $(man chmod)
    >
    [SHELL] man chmod

    [FELINE]
    Sure! I'll translate the "chmod" manual into Klingon. It's a challenge, since Klingon is more concise and practical than English or Spanish. Here it is, with its interpretation. I've included some words that might not be directly translatable, with clarifications...
